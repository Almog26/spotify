Overview
This project is designed as the front end of a Spotify-like application. It focuses on delivering a smooth and responsive user interface using the latest web technologies. With this template, you can quickly get started on building your music streaming app, complete with React components and fast refresh capabilities.

Key Features
Currently, two official plugins are available to enhance your development experience:

@vitejs/plugin-react: Uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
